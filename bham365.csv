   Learn to make an elegant hand-crafted “Baron” Fountain Pen!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p style="""">
  <font face=""Ubuntu"" style=""font-size: 18px;"">
   The “Baron” fountain pen is trimmed with nibs, clips and other elements made out of the highest quality silver plating which gives each pen a distinguished look in addition to durability. Experience in turning would be helpful but is not required.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p style="""">
  <font face=""Ubuntu"" style=""font-size: 18px;"">
   The fountain pen features an ultra-smooth threading removable cap that screws on to both the bottom and top of the pen. The Baron Fountain Pen not only is a great looking pen, but it is also light weight and one of the smoothest writing instruments available for everyday use and has a two-tone German made nib with an iridium tip. The artistic fittings are hand worked and polished and the solid metal external components add to the pens expensive and hardy feel.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p style="""">
  <font face=""Ubuntu"" style=""font-size: 18px;"">
   The Baron comes with both a siphon pump and blue ink cartridge. This hand-crafted pen will make a unique gift to others or yourself and will be completely one-of-a-kind!
  </font>
 </p>
 <p style="""">
  <font face=""Ubuntu"" style=""font-size: 18px;"">
   Each pen will be turned from beautiful exotic woods such as: King Cocobolo, Olivewood, Burmese Rosewood, Cherry Burl, Boxelder Burl, Red Mailee Burl, Bocote, Spalted Tamarind, Box Elder, etc. Students may choose silver plated or gold for the pen kit.

   My love for collecting vintage sewing machines have opened many paths for me. I have restored a long lost vintage singer machine. Then I grew into acquiring an industrial sewing machine.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>

   As a resident of Los Angeles, Ca., my exposure allowed me to experience production and percument in the fabric district in the downtown area.

   Pillow covers were my most requested items to make. I found such ease to kick out these projects on an industrial machine.

     As far as knives are concerned, the harder the steel, the better the edge, however, the harder edge makes for a brittle knife. A balance is needed between the soft flexible metal and the hard brittle metal to achieve a knife that will hold an edge without breaking. In this class more techniques for blade smithing will be covered, including various heat treatments, tapering, and tempering methods used to maximize strength with durability.
