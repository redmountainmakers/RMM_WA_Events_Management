 ” Fountain Pen!\n  </font>\n </p>\n <p style="">\n  <font face="Ubuntu" 
 style="font-size: 18px\;">\n   The “Baron” fountain pen is trimmed wit
 h nibs\, clips and other elements made out of the highest quality silver p
 lating which gives each pen a distinguished look in addition to durability
 . Experience in turning would be helpful but is not required.\n  </font>\n
  </p>\n <p style="">\n  <font face="Ubuntu" style="font-size: 18px\;">\n  
  The fountain pen features an ultra-smooth threading removable cap that sc
 rews on to both the bottom and top of the pen. The Baron Fountain Pen not 
 only is a great looking pen\, but it is also light weight and one of the s
 moothest writing instruments available for everyday use and has a two-tone
  German made nib with an iridium tip. The artistic fittings are hand worke
 d and polished and the solid metal external components add to the pens exp
 ensive and hardy feel.\n  </font>\n </p>\n <p style="">\n  <font face="Ubu
 ntu" style="font-size: 18px\;">\n   The Baron comes with both a siphon pum
 p and blue ink cartridge. This hand-crafted pen will make a unique gift to
